Hi Professor Stein, as you can see I just zipped all the relevant materials involved in my project in this file. The images and text files are, of course, the data used. finalProject.ipynb contains my experimentation with the other parts of the project. I figured I should include it, as it was a fair amount of work, but my main project is in machineLearning.ipynb. If you don't want to generate a new model over the course of a few hours I've also included the saved model file, Overfitting.h5. I haven't tried loading it but you could load that to see how the network works.
